This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links on Android.  The `getInitialURL()` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link was opened, causing the app to not properly handle the link. This is particularly noticeable when the app is launched directly from a deep link and the `getInitialURL()` call is made within `componentDidMount` or a similar lifecycle method. The issue appears to be intermittent and is not consistently reproducible.
